## Hey there, I'm Alex! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Alex**, a **Computer Science student at Stanford University** passionate about building meaningful tools.

### What drives me:

Iâ€™m a first-generation, low-income student who believes **discipline and curiosity can change everything**.  
My mission is to build tools that make opportunity accessible, one project at a time.
